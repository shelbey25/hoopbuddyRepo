# hoopbuddyRepo

Training contains the data I used to train various models.
Models contain the models I utilize.
Analysis contains the implementation of those models to derive meaningful data.

This repository has been created from the files I used locally, so doesn't have a commit history of incremental progress. Additionally, it has been organized to be more easily accessible to an external audience, so it does not have my runs and experimentation from running the analysis code files, so the output directories are not present but could be easily updated if someone wants to run the code on their device.
